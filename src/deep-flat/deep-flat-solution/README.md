## Strategy

To use a method that flattens array of any depth.

---

## Implementation

- Create a new array to avoid side-effects.
- Use `Array.flat()` method to flatten the old array. As far as we want to flatten array
  of any depth, we specify 'Infinity' as a parameter.
- Assign result to the newArray.
- Return the new array.
